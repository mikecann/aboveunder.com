    "description": "This shot was taken of the crystal clear waters of Shell Beach in Western Australia.\n\nIts hard show off a beach that is made famous by being composed entirely by trillions of tiny shells with a drone. The waters however were super clear and shallow so when taken at a particular time of the day with particular wind conditions you end up with this stunning play of light and water on the white Shelly sand."
