First stop on our epic 5-month adventure was at the sea side town of Lancelin just a few hundred K's north of Perth.

A seaside town that was super windy which the numerous Kite Surfers were taking advantage of.

We only had one night here so not much time to explore around but I was keen to take some drone photography one of the main attractions here; the dunes.

We finished off the day with a beautiful sunset and a glass on wine by the sea.
